🤟 ESP32 Gesture-Controlled Home Automation
          This project enables touchless control of home appliances using simple hand gestures detected via a gesture sensor (like the APDS-9960) and the ESP32 microcontroller. It offers a futuristic, hygienic, and user-friendly solution for smart homes by replacing traditional switches with hand gestures.

🔧 Features
    🖐️ Control devices via hand gestures (e.g., swipe up/down)
    
    ⚙️ Relay-based switching for lights, fans, or appliances
    
    📲 Optional remote control using Blynk mobile app
    
    📘 Real-time feedback in Blynk app or LEDs
    
    📡 Wi-Fi-enabled system for cloud integration
    
    🔄 Easily extendable to multiple devices

🧠 Hardware Components
        Component	                              Quantity
        ESP32 Development Board                    	1
        Gesture Sensor (APDS-9960 or similar)	      1
        Relay Module (1/2/4 Channel)	          As required
        Jumper Wires	                            Several
        Breadboard	                                1
        Power Supply (5V)                          	1
        Optional: LEDs, Buzzer	                As needed



✅ Required Libraries
    Install these libraries from the Arduino Library Manager:
    
    SparkFun APDS-9960
    
    Blynk (for ESP32, if you want cloud/app control)



✅ Wiring Connections
        APDS-9960 Pin    	ESP32 Pin
        
        VCC	                3.3V
        GND	                 GND
        SDA	               GPIO 21
        SCL	               GPIO 22
        INT	               Not used


        
        Relay Module	    ESP32 Pin
        IN1	                GPIO 13
        VCC	                 5V
        GND	                GND




✅ Gesture Actions in Code
          Gesture	Action
          Swipe UP	Turn ON Appliance
          Swipe DOWN	Turn OFF Appliance
          Swipe LEFT	No action (custom)
          Swipe RIGHT	No action (custom)

🧪 How It Works
      Gesture sensor detects hand movements like swipe up or down
      
      ESP32 reads the gesture and maps it to appliance control
      
      Relays are triggered to switch appliances ON/OFF
      
      The Blynk app (if integrated) updates real-time device status
      


🔄 Flow of Operation
    User swipes hand up/down over the gesture sensor.
    
    ESP32 reads the gesture input.
    
    Relay module activates or deactivates the connected appliance.
    
    Optional: Blynk app shows updated status.
